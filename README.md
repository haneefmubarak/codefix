Know of any hard-to-find pieces of *useful* code that could use a
cleaning and that would benefit from increased exposure to search
engines (esp. GitHub Code Search and Google)?

Fork this project, add the original code in `./original/[code]`
and in `./[code]`, fix the code in `./[code]`, and send a pull
request!

Yes folks, it really is that easy. :)

PS: Do all of your work in a new branch named `[code]`, for example,
all of the work for `./gost.c` was done in
